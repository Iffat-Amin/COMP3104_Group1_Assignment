IThe shift to remote work has fundamentally altered how software development teams operate. This paradigm shift, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to the adoption of collaboration tools such as Zoom, Slack, and GitHub for seamless communication and project management. Agile methodologies have gained popularity as teams navigate the challenges of remote collaboration, fostering adaptability and rapid iteration. However, this new work environment also raises concerns about work-life balance, team cohesion, and the effectiveness of remote training. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for future software development practices as organizations embrace hybrid work models.Thanks.
