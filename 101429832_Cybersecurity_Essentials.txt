In the digital age, cybersecurity has become an essential focus for organizations of all sizes. With the rise in cyber threats, integrating security into the software development life cycle (SDLC) has never been more critical. The DevSecOps approach emphasizes embedding security measures early in the development process, ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated proactively. Organizations are adopting frameworks such as Zero Trust and leveraging automation tools for continuous security assessments, highlighting the importance of a robust cybersecurity strategy in safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining trust with customers.
