Cybersecurity has become one of the most critical aspects of the digital age, as the expansion of interconnected devices, cloud services, and AI-driven technologies has increased the attack surface for cybercriminals. From individuals to governments and businesses, everyone is vulnerable to cyber threats such as malware, ransomware, phishing, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In response, cybersecurity involves a multifaceted approach that includes encryption, firewalls, multi-factor authentication, and advanced AI-driven tools that detect, prevent, and mitigate threats in real-time. The growing sophistication of cyberattacks, often state-sponsored or driven by organized crime, has led to the development of national and international policies, cybersecurity frameworks, and compliance standards to protect critical infrastructure, financial systems, healthcare networks, and personal data.

Beyond technical measures, human behavior plays a significant role in cybersecurity. Social engineering, where attackers manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information, is a common method used to bypass even the most advanced defenses. Therefore, security awareness training and practices like strong password management, regular software updates, and cautious online behavior are essential components of a robust cybersecurity strategy.
